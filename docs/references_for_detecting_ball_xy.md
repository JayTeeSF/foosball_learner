This is a challenging task that requires some knowledge of JavaScript, canvas, and image processing. Based on web search results, I found some possible resources that might help you:

- A GitHub topic page that lists several repositories related to foosballÂ². Some of them are games written in JavaScript or other languages, and some of them are tools or bots for tracking foosball scores or stats. You might find some useful code snippets or ideas from these projects.
- A Medium article that explains how to make a foosball game with JavaScriptÂ³. It uses HTML5 canvas to draw the game elements and SAT.js library to handle collision detection. It also shows how to use keyboard events to control the players and how to implement a timer and a score system. This article might give you some guidance on how to create a basic foosball game logic and UI.
- A Stack Overflow answer that provides a function to get the coordinates of selected text in a browser pageÂ¹. It uses window.getSelection() method and range.getClientRects() method to get the x and y values of the selection. You might be able to adapt this function to get the coordinates of a foosball image on a canvas by using canvas.getContext() method and imageData.data property.

I hope these resources are helpful for your task. Good luck! ðŸ˜Š
